The problem is further magnified by the major challenge of vertical fragmentation due to the technological variety of various systems and devices offered by different vendors that prevent interoperability, data distribution and secure exchange of information between multiple devices and systems. This renders installation/mine automation, control, safety, and reliability ineffective from a design and operations perspective.
